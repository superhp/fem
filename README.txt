I have been developing a research tool for modelling 1D and 2D heat transfer problemsby using the finite element method. I have programmed it in Matlab by exploiting objec-toriented paradigm, GUI interface, MySQL DBMS, and later parallel computing toolbox.The whole software consists of over 2000 lines of code in Matlab language.
